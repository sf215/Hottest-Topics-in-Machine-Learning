# Hottest-Topics-in-Machine-Learning
Use Natural Language Processing on NIPS papers to uncover the trendiest topics in machine learning research

Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) is one of the top machine learning conferences in the world where groundbreaking work is published. In this Project, I analyzed a large collection of NIPS research papers from the past decade to discover the latest trends in machine learning. 
Dataset : 
The dataset is downloaded from - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/benhamner/nips-papers?select=papers.csv
PDF files were  downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. These NIPS papers are stored in datasets/papers.csv. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more.


Libraries: 
I used different pyton libraries especially in NLP. 
Wordcloud, pandas, sklearn(CountVectorizer, LDA), numpy, matplotlib,
